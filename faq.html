    <h1>How do I know when there is someone nearby who wants to volunteer in my class?</h1>
        <p1>Lend-a-Hand notifies teachers when a volunteer matches their criteria in their area. Teachers will also receive a notification whenever they receive a personal
message from a volunteer asking for more information about their class. </p1>
            <br>
            <br>
    <h1>As a volunteer do I need to have past experience with children?</h1>
        <p1>It is not necessary, but it is prefered by many teachers that their volunteers have experience working with students prior to working in their classroom.</p1>
            <br>
            <br>
    <h1>How long are the volunteers available?</h1>
